### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

Working on this project I have practiced my CSS and Javascript skills. I have learned how to create a responsive navigation bar, a lightbox, how to work with SVG images, how to create a preview cart component and make everything responsive for different devices.

### Continued development

I would like to improve the CSS, to make it more compact and reusable. I would also add another page with more products, a checkout page, a collections page etc.

### Useful resources

- [Click outside div-Javascript](https://www.techiedelight.com/hide-div-click-outside-javascript/) - This hides a component if clicked outside of it. This helped me hide the cart component and I would like to use it in future projects.

- [Using SVG](https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/) - This helped me work with SVG images.

- [Creating a lightbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKVVSwXdLr0) - This taught me how to create a lightbox.
